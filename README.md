# Gaming-Prediction-Analytics
End of year project. Sales of games forecast. Prediction of sales globally through their characteristics. Regression based models and visualisation. 

Abstract: 

The video game industry are growing significantly and the need for video game prediction models are talked about. Numerous companies, developers etc. are in need of a sales forecast. This study will cover ‘Predicting sales of video games globally based on their EU sales and other characteristics’ through ‘Video Games Sales with Ratings’ Dataset with multiple features to consider. With the use of multiple algorithms (Linear Regression, DecisionTreeRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, SVR) as our proposed approach the performance of the models will be recorded. Most of the algorithms were not significantly different and share the same accuracy standard dependent on the factor upon. 

Objectives:

1.	Adapt a model to cope with the formulated problem,
2.	Compare aspects involved ML&AI,
3.	Critically evaluate and practice/use a range of algorithms, tools and frameworks,
4.	Demonstrate skills in formulating problems,
5.	Apply learned algorithms, tools and frameworks to solve real life problems,
6.	Apply model to real life problem.
